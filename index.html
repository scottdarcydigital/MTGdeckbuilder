<p>Welcome to the new version 2.0 of the MTG Deck builder. Previously, this was created by uploading an export of all the card data on scryfall as a JSON object, uploading it to Firebase and then reading from that endpoint in firebase</p>
<p>However, this time I wish to read using a REST API in JS in order to contact an open GET request to scryfall's API endpoint and return all the relevant URLS dynamticall over this website</p>
<p> A good tutorial on getting started with this was found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTjd1nwvlj4</p>
<p> and was used in conjunction with the vanilla JS function of JSON.parse(JS_Obj)</p>
